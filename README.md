# VirtualTourist

This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. 

- First the user drops a pin in a selected location on the map, which triggers a download of pictures taken on that location.
- When a pin is tapped the user can either delete or open the photo album list associated with that location. 
- For every photo album, the app let users download a new set of pictures or delete pictures individually.
- The user can create new albums, edit or delete existing ones for every single location.
